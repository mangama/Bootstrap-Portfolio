# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Responsiveness Assignment


Overview

The aim of this project is to built a sample of portfolio layout using Bootstrap CSS framework along with a mobile responsiveness.


Steps:

1. Created a new GitHub repository and named it Bootstrap-Portfolio. 

2. Inside the  Bootstrap-Portfolio repository cloned on my comupter, I created an index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html. Using Bootstrap, I recreated a portfolio site with the following items:
    - A navbar
    - A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends).eg. On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

The Bootstrap project should minimize use of media queries.
