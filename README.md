Overview

The aim of this project is to built a sample of portfolio layout using Bootstrap CSS framework along with a mobile responsiveness.


Steps:

1. Create two new GitHub repositories and name them Bootstrap-Portfolio and Responsive-Portfolio. Clone these repositories to your computer.

2. Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
    - A navbar
    - A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends).eg. On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

The Bootstrap project should minimize use of media queries.
